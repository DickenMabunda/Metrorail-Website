            <span className="p-black">Metrorail</span> is an operator of
            commuter rail services in the major urban areas of South Africa. It
            is a division of the <span className="p-black">Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa</span>(PRASA),
            a state-owned enterprise which is responsible for most passenger
            rail services in South Africa. The Metrorail system consists of 471
            stations, 2,228 kilometres (1,384 mi) of track, and carries an
            average of 1.7 million passengers per weekday. Metrorail was
            formed in 1996 as a business unit of Transnet and was transferred to
            the South African Rail Commuter Corporation (SARCC), the predecessor
            of PRASA. In the early-1990s Metrorail was placed under Spoornet,
            another business unit of Transnet but on 1 January 1997, Metrorail
            became an independent business within Transnet and the Metrorail
            regions were formed. In 2006 Metrorail was transferred back into the
            SARCC; in 2008 the SARCC became PRASA.
